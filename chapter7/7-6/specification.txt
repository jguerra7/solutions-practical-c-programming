Positives is a program that takes a series of numbers and counts the number and negative numbers.

When the program is run it will prompt and ask for a series of numbers.
After the user input, the program will count the number of positive and negative values and display the result.

For example (user input is between *stars*):
*positives*
Enter a series of numbers, press q when you are done.
*5*
*-9*
*123*
*243*
*-21*
*q*

Result:
3 positive number(s)
2 negative number(s)
