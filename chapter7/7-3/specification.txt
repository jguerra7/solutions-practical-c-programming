Transtime is a program that calculates the time required to send a file by serial transmission.

When the program is run it will prompt and ask the file size.
After the user input, the program will calculate and display the time needed to send the file.

The user has to enter the file size as a number and also the unit type.
Valid unit types are:
- kB
- MB
- GB

The program will validate the unit type and display an error message when the unit type is invalid.

The result will be returned in an appriopriate time unit.
i.e. a 400 MB file will take days, so the result will be in number of days.

For example (user input is between *stars*):
*transtime*
Input format:
number type

Valid unit types:
kB (note the smaller case k)
MB
GB

Enter the file size and unit type: *400 MB*
Required time: x days

Example of invalid input:
*transtime*
Input format:
number type

Valid unit types:
kB (note the smaller case k)
MB
GB

Enter the file size and unit type: *400 kg*
Error: invalid input
Enter the file size and unit type: *400 MB*
Required time: x days
