Count Days is a program that counts the number of days between two given dates.

When the program is run it will promt and ask for two dates.
It will also display the expected date format for input.
After the user input, the program will calculate and display the number of dates between the two dates.

The following date format is valid and expected:
d-m-Y i.e. 24-12-2019

The program will display a error message when the date format is invalid. After the message it will re prompt for input.

For example (user input is between *stars*):
*countdays*
Valid date format: dd-mm-yyyy

Enter the first date: *10-12-2019*
Enter the second date: *12-12-2019*
There are 2 day(s) between 10-12-2019 and 12-12-2019.

Invalid input example
*countdays*
Valid date format: dd-mm-yyyy

Enter the first date: *2019/12/10*
Invalid date, try again.
Enter the first date: *10-12-2019*
Enter the second date: *12-12-2019*
There is/are 2 day(s) between 10-12-2019 and 12-12-2019.
