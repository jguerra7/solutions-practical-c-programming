Add tax is a program that adds 8% sales tax to a given amount returns the result, rounded to pennies.

When the program is run it will prompt and ask for the amount in dollars.
After the user input, the program will calculate and display the tax amount and total amount.

The program will also validate the user input.
When the input is invalid a error message will be shown and the user will have to reenter the amount.

For example (user input is between *stars*):
*addtax*
Enter the amount in dollars: *50.50*
The 8% sales tax is $ 4.04
The total amount with tax is $ 54.54

Example of invalid input:
*addtax*
Enter the amount in dollars: *dollar*
Error: invalid input amount
Enter the amount in dollars: *50.50*
The 8% sales tax is $ 4.04
The total amount with tax is $ 54.54
